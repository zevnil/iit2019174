COMPETITIVE CODING:
I expect the nerdy mathematical stuff from it, challenging questions and lots of contests.
It would be fun.. when it's not exhausting. 

FOSS:
Git seems almost indispensable for creating any major project, and while coding seems a bit vague at present, I'm expecting to be working on real things in this wing.
Contributing to open source seems very exciting, good for my CV, and hopefully for my pocket too!

CYBER SECURITY:
It seems hands-down the coolest. Ethical or not, it is hacking that they do! (And of course.. other computer security related things.. and flag tournaments...)
I've not started with it yet, but I certainly am intrigued by it.
